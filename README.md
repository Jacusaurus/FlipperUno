The game is an Uno-based card game that brings in toggleable changes to spice up the game. 
The game will contain classic house rules like: stackable draw-twos, card jumping, and swap cards. 
The game will also contain different rules for certain played cards, ex. a 0 allows the player 
to swap hands with another player. The game may also contain new cards that bring in new rules! 
Each of these new rules can be toggled out individually to allow players to choose their rules. 
The plan is to make the game multiplayer if time allows, but at the very least the user will be able 
to play single-player with a choice of how many computers they want to play against.
